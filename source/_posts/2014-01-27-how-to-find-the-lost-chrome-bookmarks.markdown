how to find the lost Chrome bookmarks
***

I don't know why, but one day when I open my Chrome, all the bookmarks gone. I'm still signed in with my gmail account. I believe these bookmarks are stored locally. The last bak file I can find is 5 month ago. 

I find a way to find a possible backup via [Google search](http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/EUMCNrG8J1M);

> I found the backup version of my bookmark but it is 15 days old. Atleast I found a place there Google Chrome keeps a backup copy but it is located in some obscure folder directory.
>C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
>There is a file called: Bookmarks.bak.  The sad part that i can not simply rename this file to Bookmarks aand for chrome to be back in business. One has to locate a JSON parser to parse through this JSON file into a html file for Chrome to ingest the html bookmark. I am looking around for a JSON parser into HTML then ingest this new html file into my PC chrome browser.

Folder in my local is D:\Users\$name\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default

You can find the file Bookmarks.bak with JSON format.
